# Project: Sentiment Analysis On Flipkart Reviews

## Requirement:
As Customer's reviews affect the sales of the company, so it is most important for the company to categorise the sentiments as positive, negative and neutral.
It is too difficult to read all the reviews. So with the help of Data science, Business Leaders can visualise the data and find whether customer's reviews are good or bad regarding product.
